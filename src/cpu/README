CPU-dependent subdirectories

The "host" subdirectory contains compiler macros (compiler.mk)
for the case where the host and target have the same instruction
set, so cross-compilation is unnecessary.

Other subdirectories contain various CPU-dependent routines,
and compiler macros for cross-compilation (i.e. the locations
of the cross-compiler utilities).
