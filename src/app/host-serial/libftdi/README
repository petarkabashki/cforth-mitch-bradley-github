The files in this directory are from version 1.2 of the libftdi distribution
from http://www.intra2net.com/developer/libftdi .  The full distribution
contains various pieces that we do not need, including interfaces to
Python and C++ plus a complex library build and testing infrastructure
that requires the installation of numerous packages.  The only thing we
care about is the one C source file ftdi.c plus its include files, which
we compile and link directly instead of packaging it as a library, thus
avoiding all of the extra complexity and the need for those packages.
